# dotfiles
A collection of my dotfiles

In order to set the background run `feh --bg-scale Pictures/1.jpg` and it should be set on startup in the future.

I use systemd-boot as my boot loader and the config can be found it the loader directory. I also use betterlockscreen package to manage the lockscreen and configured it to use the same image as my background.
